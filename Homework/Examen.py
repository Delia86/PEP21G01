"""
A factory needs an iterable object to keep track of employee working hours for each day.
Each employee has a string name and a tuple containing start work and end work time (use format you like).
Iterating the object will return tuple with name and hours worked that day for each employee
1) 40p: Definition
    a) 10p: Class with constructor that receives the date in the format you desire (representing the day)
    b) 10p: Create method to add worker start time
         - if start time has already been added a custom exception inheriting ValueError (exception: WorkStartError)
         exception will be raised with message indicating employee name and existing start time
    c) 10p: Create method to add worker end time
         - if end time has already been added a custom exception inheriting ValueError (exception: WorkEndError)
         exception will be raised with message indicating employee name and existing end time
    c) 10p: Iterating the object will return tuple with name and hours worked that day for each employee
2) 40p: Execution:
    a) 10p: Create instance of class with date format you selected.
    b) 10p: Add start of work for the following employees:
        - Joe: 09:01:20 - start time
        - Ana: 09:03:15 - start time
        - Tim: 09:04:25 - start time
        - Tim: 09:04:30 - start time - treat this exception
    c) 10p: Add end of work for the following employees:
        - Joe: 16:01:20 - end time
        - Ana: 18:04:15 - end time
        - Tim: 18:05:25 - end time
        - Tim: 18:05:30 - end time - treat this exception
    d) 10p: Iterate the created object and save each value on a new line in a file
3) 20p: Documenting:
   a) 5p: type hints for all arguments (optional for returned values)
   a) 5p: module documentation
   b) 5p: class documentation for all classes
   c) 5p: method documentation for all methods
